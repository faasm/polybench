# PolyBench/C in Faasm

This repository contains a slightly modified [Polybench/C benchmark](
https://sourceforge.net/projects/polybench/) for its use with [Faasm](
https://github.com/faasm/faasm).

In particular, we cross-compile PolyBench/C to WebASsembly, and compare it to
native execution. For the cross-compilation scripts, check the [examples](
https://github.com/faasm/examples/tree/main/tasks/polybench.py).

TODO: what benchmarks are not there and why?
